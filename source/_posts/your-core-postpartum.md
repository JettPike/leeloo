If we teach anything linked to motion for postnatal mamas, someone asks about core motions, protection, and diastasis recti (DR). Unless you really know what that very last thing is usually, count yourself lucky. Many mamas cope with "the gap" postpartum. DR can be when the connective cells (linea alba) between a central primary muscle tissue (rectus abdominis) stretches out and doesn't un- stretch out itself after baby arrives. Self- examine tests abound online, and you will also ask your physician or midwife to check on you, too. There's lots of uncertainty in what having DR means, as very little study exists on the problem. It could correlate with low-back discomfort or pelvic ground dysfunction. ( It could not, though, particularly if it's not an extremely big gap. Don't panic when you have it! ) But due to the uncertainty, if you know you own it, seek advice from with a pelvic PT to create options to securely strengthen.

As you begin to move on your own, though, it's helpful to have a sense of what is safe to do postpartum. The moves in this post are safe for postpartum mamas with our without DR and they're safe for mamas who birthed vaginally or via Cesarean.

First, let's consider what to avoid: When doing any postpartum core work, avoid big twists in challenging poses (like twisting from high lunge), deep back bends (like wheel pose or bow pose), and all crunch-type poses or movements. Basically, you don't want to put too much stress on the core area. ( Gentle backbends and twists tend fine. )

Next, always just work at the speed commensurate with where you're at in your healing process. If you are performing a pose and experience unable to maintain primary engagement, have a break from the pose. If you are newly-ish postpartum, go gradually and do less.

Finally, consider starting right here. They are great, beginning movements to rebuild and restrengthen!

#### Engaged Mountain Pose

Stand tall, together with your feet hip distance apart. Lengthen your tailbone and soften your knees, which ensures that your hip and legs aren’t locked. Tuck in your lowest ribs, but don’t enable your shoulders to roll forwards as you perform. Take a breath in, and as you exhale breath out through the mouth area, engaging your deepest level of primary by pulling your belly-button against your backbone. This is an excellent first pose to begin with in postpartum recovery!

#### Bridge with block

Begin on your back again. Place a block or ball in the middle of your thighs. Lift into bridge pose, floating your chair, low back again and rib cage away the mat. Press your heels in to the mat and lengthen your tailbone, engaging your primary. Inhale right here, and as you exhale, squeeze in to the block, draw your bellybutton against your backbone (engage your core even more ), and engage pelvic flooring muscles ( do a kegel). Inhale to soften all of those places of engagement; exhale to engage again. Repeat 3-8 times.

#### Supine Leg Press

Begin on your back. Lift your legs, stacking your knees over your hips and your shins parallel to the mat. Place your hands on your thighs. Press your low back into the mat and tuck in your lowest ribs. Take a breath in, and as you exhale press your hands in to your thighs (but resist and do not allow your legs to move. ) Repeat this, inhaling to soften and exhaling to press, for 3-10 breaths. Keep your head and neck on the mat.

Happy strengthening, mamas!
