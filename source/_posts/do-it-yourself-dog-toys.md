#### Ball Toys

Among the easiest toys to create is made from a ball and a durable sock. Be sure that the ball is certainly big enough which signifies that your puppy can’t swallow it. A lot of people make use of tennis balls, nevertheless, you can even make use of newspaper that’s crumpled together to form a tight ball. Place the ball snugly inside the sock and tie a tight knot to total the toy.

Another way to create a ball toy is usually to tightly compress some sheets of newspaper into a ball, then completely cover all of the surfaces with duct tape. This toy would give hours of fun for your dog to swat and chase around. Make sure to supervise your pooch when playing so they wouldn’t swallow the ball or chew through the duct tape.

#### Tug Toys

In most DIY tutorials, you literally need one thing to make a tug toy work - a piece of fabric. Whether it’s fleece, an old kitchen towel, old shirts, or denim jeans, the possibilities are limitless with the type of pull toys you can create. I have even tied varies “ body parts ” of old toys together to create one “ new ” toy. Braid the fabric to create a simple pull toy. Durable fabric such as denim would make for a sturdier toy when braided tightly.

#### Chew Toys

Chew toys can come in all forms and sizes. One of the simplest chew toys that you can give your pooch is usually a plastic bottle (without the label and the plastic cap). Flatten the bottle and enclose it around some fabric. A sock, cut up denim jeans, or aged towels would do. Sew any openings shut before giving it to your dog. The crinkly sound of the plastic material bottle could keep them entertained all night!

#### Treat Dispensing Toys

This is an excellent toy for dogs with separation anxiety. You can put in a few treats in the gadget before you leave plus they wouldn’t even observe that you’re gone! Plastic material containers are excellent for little breeds or canines that aren't chewers. The tougher materials, like PVC plastic material tubes, are suggested for larger dogs and canines who have a tendency to chew through everything. Cut little holes in the containers big more than enough that would enable the treats to undergo. Fill up the container with some dried out kibble treats and ensure that you safely close the container. Display your pooch that treats fall through the holes and allow them go crazy with it.

Most of these playthings are simple to make without time at all. An email of caution, though - it can help to remember that people should supervise our house animals ’ playtime. Most canines will chew through anything and swallow everything! Understanding your dog’s character and using good sense can save you from a vacation to the veterinarian and much medical bill.
